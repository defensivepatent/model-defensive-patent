SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IN WHICH CASE SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.  LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.
  
### FRAND licensing after withdrawal ###
If Licensor withdraws, then even after they cease to be a DPL user, that is, after their Discontinuation Date (if any), they incur a perpetual obligation to offer any patents that were Licensed Patents at any time during their Participation Period to any other entites who were Licensees at any time before Licensor's Discontinuation Announcement (Past Licensees), under fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

They also incur an obligation to bind any successors or any parties that they transfer the patents to, to do the same (to offer them on FRAND terms to the Past Licensees).
