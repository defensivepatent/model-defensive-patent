### 2. License Grant ###
  
1. Subject to the conditions and limitations of this License and upon affirmative assent to the commitments specified in Section 1.3 from an individual DPL User, Licensor hereby grants to such DPL User a worldwide, royalty-free, no-charge, non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated in Section 2.2(f)) license, perpetual for the term of the relevant Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and distribute products that would otherwise infringe any claim of Licensed Patents.
  
2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this License is expressly subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  
	(a) This License does not include the right to sublicense any Licensed Patent.
  
	(b) This License does not include any copyright, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property, or other rights of Licensor other than the rights to Licensed Patents granted in Section 2.1.
  
	(c) This License does not include Patents with a priority date or Effective Filing Date later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.
  
	(d) This License does not extend to any DPL User whose Offering Announcement occurs later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.
  
	(e) Licensor reserves the right to revoke this License
  
	*(i)* with regard to a named Licensee upon written notice, if such named Licensee asserts any patent infringement claim in any form or forum, not including Defensive Patent Claims, against any DPL User or its Affiliate or their products or services, including but not limited to Licensor, and such named Licensee does not dismiss or otherwise withdraw its patent infringement claim within 30 days after receiving such notice. In such event, Licensor shall retain its License to such named Licensee’s Licensed Patents hereunder. In order to revoke, the revoking Licensor must include in its written notice to the named Licensee the fact that the Entity against whom the named Licensee has asserted the patent infringement claim is a DPL User or its Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, a patent infringement claim made against an Entity that was not a DPL User or its Affiliate at the time the claim was made does not trigger the revocation right under this Section 2.2(c), even if such Entity later becomes a DPL User.
  
	*(ii)* if Licensee discontinues being a DPL User, as of the date of such Licensee’s Discontinuation Date; or
  
	*(iii)* if Licensee transfers a Patent to an entity or individual other than a DPL User without conditioning the transfer on the transferee continuing to abide by the terms of this license for as long as Licensee is a DPL User.
  
	(f) Licensor makes no representations and disclaims any and all warranties as to the validity of the Licensed Patents or that products or processes covered by Licensed Patents do not infringe the patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any other party.
  
	(g) UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE PATENT LICENSE GRANTED HEREIN “AS IS” AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT EMBODYING ANY LICENSED PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISCOVERABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IN WHICH CASE SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.  LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.
