	(a) This License does not include the right to sublicense any Licensed Patent.
  
	(b) This License does not include any copyright, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property, or other rights of Licensor other than the rights to Licensed Patents granted in Section 2.1.

### Transfers ###

a) In the event a Licensor (the 'Transferring Licensor') transfers a Patent or Patent application during its Participation Period, (a 'Transfer'), other than by operation of law, then prior to the Transfer the Transferring Licensor automatically grants, to each Licensee existing at the time of the Transfer, a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license under such transferred Patent and to any Patent that may issue based upon such transferred Patent application (collectively, the 'Transferred Patents') to make, have made (subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(b) above), operate, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or distribute Licensed Products and Services, and such grant shall automatically continue after such Transfer with respect to each Licensee at the time of the Transfer for so long as each such Licensee remains a DPL User; provided that, such License shall terminate whichever is sooner of:

       (i) as to a particular Licensee upon any applicable Discontinuation Date of such Licensee

       (ii) if and only if the transfer is a Non-Assertion Transfer (as defined in Section 2.4(c)), then the License shall also terminate, for all Licensees, upon the three years from the date of the transfer. 

(b) Licensor shall give written notice to the transferee at the time of the transfer that each Transferred Patent shall be subject to the License set forth herein in accordance with the preceding sentence and in accordance with Section 2.4(d) below. Licensor shall give written notice to the DPL Foundation at the time of the transfer of the patents transferred, and the identity of the transferee, unless the transferree is also a DPL User who has not made a Discontinuation Announcement after their most recent Offering Announcement.

(c) For purposes of this Section 2.4, a 'Non-Assertion Transfer' means a transaction in which there is a Transfer by a Transferring Licensor of one or more Transferred Patents to a transferee and both of the following are true:
        (i) such transaction is accompanied by a substantially contemporaneous transfer of a business line of the Transferring Licensor to which the Transferred Patents relate and the transferee actively continues to engage in such transferred part of the business after the Transfer and 
        (ii) the transferee is not an entity that derives the majority of its revenue through patent assertion.

d) For all patent transfers, including but not limited to patents transfers by operation of law or in connection with a Non-Assertion Transfer, each DPL User agrees that any financial benefit received by the Transferring Licensor before, after, or in conjuction with the Transfer based on patent assertion by the transferee of the Transferred Patents will be returned to any DPL User against whom such patent assertion is made.
