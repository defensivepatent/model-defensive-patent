### 2. License Grant ###
  
1. Subject to the conditions and limitations of this License and upon affirmative assent to the commitments specified in Section 1.3 and Section 12 from an individual DPL User, Licensor hereby grants to such DPL User a worldwide, royalty-free, no-charge, non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated in Section 2.2(e)) license, perpetual for the term of the relevant Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and distribute products that would otherwise infringe any claim of Licensed Patents.

Termination of Licenses Upon Withdrawal. If a DPL User withdraws from the DPL by issuing a Discontinuation Announcement then, as of the applicable Discontinuation Date, the License of the withdrawing DPL User and its Affiliates to the Licensed Patents of other Licensors is automatically terminated and each Licensee’s License to the Licensed Patents of the withdrawing DPL User and its Affiliates is automatically terminated.  

2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this License is expressly subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  
	(a) This License does not include the right to sublicense any Licensed Patent.
  
	(b) This License does not include any copyright, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property, or other rights of Licensor other than the rights to Licensed Patents granted in Section 2.1.
  
	(c) This License does not include Patents with a priority date or Effective Filing Date later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.
  
	(d) This License does not extend to any DPL User whose Offering Announcement occurs later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.
  
	(e) Licensor reserves the right to revoke this License if
  
	*(i)* Licensee makes any Infringement Claim, not including Defensive Patent Claims, against a DPL User; or
  
	*(ii)* Licensee discontinues being a DPL User, as of the date of such Licensee’s Discontinuation Date; or
  
	*(iii)* Licensee transfers a Patent to an Entity other than a DPL User without conditioning the transfer on the transferee continuing to abide by the terms of this license for as long as Licensee is a DPL User.
 
### Disclaimer of Warranties ###

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE PATENT LICENSE GRANTED HEREIN “AS IS” AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PRACTICING ANY LICENSED PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISCOVERABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IN WHICH CASE SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Licensor disclaims any and all warranties as to title or the validity of its Licensed Patents or that the exercise of the License granted by Licensor hereunder will not infringe the patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any third party.

5. Disclaimer of Liability

LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF WARRANTY, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.

6. Miscellaneous

6.1 Nothing contained in this Agreement or the performance thereof is intended or shall be construed to create any relationship of agency, partnership or joint venture between or among the parties or their Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an agreement by a Licensor to bring actions or suits against non-DPL Users or their Affiliates for infringement of its Licensed Patents, or conferring any right to a Licensee to bring actions or suits against third parties for infringement of the Licensed Patents. The provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply in accordance with their terms even after the withdrawal of an Entity from the DPL through issuance of a Discontinuation Notice.

6.2 Each DPL User and its Affiliates acknowledge and agree that a significant benefit and consideration for entering into this Agreement is to avoid the risks and uncertainty of litigation with respect to the Licensed Patents of other DPL Users and their Affiliates, a benefit which derives in significant part from the license rights that each DPL User and its Affiliates receive collectively from all other DPL Users and their Affiliates, and the DPL therefore does not reflect a royalty that any DPL User or its Affiliate might otherwise have negotiated at arms’ length with respect to any one or more particular Licensed Patents apart from this Agreement and its collective license rights, nor what would constitute a reasonable royalty or a measure of damages with respect to the enforcement of any particular Licensed Patent in any dispute or transaction outside the scope of this Agreement. Each DPL User and its Affiliates further agrees that it obtains a unique benefit from the portfolio-wide nature of the cross-licenses granted herein, and that infringement of any particular patent(s) subject to this agreement therefore may not be adequately compensated by money damages, notwithstanding the existence of the licenses granted hereunder to such patent(s).

6.3 Each DPL User and each of its Affiliates shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement with the right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement directly against Licensor.
