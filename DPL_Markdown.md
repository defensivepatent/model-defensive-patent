NOTICE: ALL RIGHTS IN LICENSED PATENTS (as defined below) PROVIDED UNDER THIS DEFENSIVE PATENT LICENSE ('DPL') ARE SUBJECT TO ALL CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS BELOW. THE MAKING, USE, SALE, OFFERING FOR SALE, IMPORTATION, OR DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS EMBODYING THE LICENSED PATENTS, OTHER THAN AS EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR PATENT LAW, IS PROHIBITED.
  
### 1. Definitions ###
  
1. 'Defensive Patent Claim' means an Infringement Claim against a party ('Target') by a Claimant or its product or service, provided that all of the following are true:
  
	(a) Defensive Patent Claim is made in response to a prior Infringement Claim ('Prior Infringement Claim') by Target or an Affiliate of Target,

	(b) the Prior Infringement Claim was against either Claimant, or an Affiliate of Claimant, or a product or service of Claimant or an Affiliate of Claimant,

	(c) Claimant is a DPL User or its Affiliate,

	(d) Target is a DPL User or its Affiliate, or was at the time of the prior Infringement Claim

  
2. 'Discontinuation Announcement' means a DPL User’s announcement that:
  
	(a) declares the DPL User’s intent to discontinue offering to license its Licensed Patents under the DPL on the Discontinuation Date; and
  
	(b) is submitted by an authorized representative to the DPL Website six months prior to a Discontinuation Date.
  
3.  'DPL User' means an Entity that:
  
	(a) has made an offering annoucement and commits to the promises in the announcement
  
	(b) and, if the Entity has made a Discontinuation Announcement, the Discontinuation Date has not yet occurred.

4. 'Discontinuation Date' means the date six (6) months after the date a Discontinuation Announcement is submitted to the DPL Website.
  
5. 'DPL Website' means a website to be established by the DPL Foundation to publish DPL announcements.
  
6. 'Infringement Claim' means a lawsuit, binding arbitration, or administrative action, or other filed legal proceeding, including a counterclaim or cross-claim, including but not limited to claims made before the International Trade Commission or similar body, alleging patent infringement.
  
7. 'License' and 'DPL' mean the grant, conditions, and limitations herein.
  
8.1 'Licensed Patent' means, with respect to a particular Licensor, any Patent owned or controlled or acquired (including through acquisition of an Entity owning or controlling such Patent) by Licensor during a Participation Period of Licensor, or with respect to which Licensor has, or later obtains, during a Participation Period of Licensor the right to grant licenses to Licensee of or within the scope granted in this License without such grant or the exercise of rights thereunder resulting in the payment of royalties or other consideration by Licensor to third parties (except for payments among Entities that form part of Licensor, and payments to third parties for inventions made by the third parties while employed by Licensor or while engaged by Licensor to make such inventions). 

8.2 With respect to any Patent of Licensor that, as of the date of commencement of the relevant Participation Period, is subject to a written exclusive license agreement or other written agreement that precludes or is inconsistent with the grant of a license to Licensee of the scope that would otherwise be granted in this License, which agreement was entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of avoiding the grant hereunder either generally or with respect to a particular DPL User or its Affiliate(s), such Patent shall be considered a Licensed Patent only to the extent of the scope of license that such agreement permits Licensor to make, and the grant of license in Section 2.1 below with respect to such Patent shall be deemed modified to such extent. 

8.3 For the avoidance of doubt, if Licensor enters into a written agreement governing one or more Patents of Licensor for the purpose of avoiding the grant hereunder to such Patents either generally or with respect to a particular DPL User or its Affiliate(s), Licensor nonetheless grants the License in Section 2.1 below with respect to such Patents.
  
9. 'Licensee' means any Entity exercising rights granted by the Licensor under this License including all Affiliates of such Entity.

10. 'Licensor' means any Entity with the right to grant licenses in Licensed Patents under this License, including all Affiliates of such Entity.

	(b)  more than fifty percent (50%) of whose profit interest representing the right to the profits of the Affiliate is now or hereafter, owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Affiliator, 
  
	(c)  the Affiliate is controlled, directly or indirectly, including through one or more intermediaries, by the Affiliator,
  
	(d)  the Affiliator is an Affiliate of Affiliate (that is to say, if A is an Affiliate of B, then B is also an Affiliate of A)
  
12. 'Offering Announcement' means an Entity’s announcement that:
  
	(a) declares the Entity's commitment to offer a license to its Patents (if any) under the DPL, and has committed to offer a license to any Patents it may obtain in the future under the DPL; and
  
	(b) contains the Entity's contact information; and
  
	(c) is submitted to the DPL Website.

        (d) was made no sooner than one year after any written exclusive license agreement or other written agreement that precludes or is inconsistent with the grant of a license to Licensee of the scope that would otherwise be granted in this License
  
13. 'Patent' means any right, now or later acquired, under any national or international patent law from a governmental body authorized to issue such rights, including rights embodied within patent applications, granted patents, including, but not limited to, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisionals, provisionals, results of any patent reexaminations, and reissues.

“Entity” means an individual, corporation, trust, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, association, unincorporated organization, subsidiary, company or other legal or governmental entity.



  
### 2. License Grant ###
  
1. Subject to the conditions and limitations of this License and upon affirmative assent to the commitments specified in Section 1.3 and Section 12 from an individual DPL User, Licensor hereby grants to such DPL User a worldwide, royalty-free, no-charge, non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated in Section 2.2(e)) license, perpetual for the term of the relevant Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and distribute products that would otherwise infringe any claim of Licensed Patents.

Termination of Licenses Upon Withdrawal. If a DPL User withdraws from the DPL by issuing a Discontinuation Announcement then, as of the applicable Discontinuation Date, the License of the withdrawing DPL User and its Affiliates to the Licensed Patents of other Licensors is automatically terminated and each Licensee’s License to the Licensed Patents of the withdrawing DPL User and its Affiliates is automatically terminated.  
  
2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this License is expressly subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  
	(a) This License does not include the right to sublicense any Licensed Patent.
  
	(b) This License does not include any copyright, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property, or other rights of Licensor other than the rights to Licensed Patents granted in Section 2.1.
  
	(c) This License does not include Patents with a priority date or Effective Filing Date later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.
  
	(d) This License does not extend to any DPL User whose Offering Announcement occurs later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.
  
	(e) Licensor reserves the right to revoke this License
  
	*(i)* with regard to a named Licensee upon written notice, if such named Licensee asserts any patent infringement claim in any form or forum, not including Defensive Patent Claims, against any DPL User or its Affiliate or their products or services, including but not limited to Licensor, and such named Licensee does not dismiss or otherwise withdraw its patent infringement claim within 30 days after receiving such notice. In such event, Licensor shall retain its License to such named Licensee’s Licensed Patents hereunder. In order to revoke, the revoking Licensor must include in its written notice to the named Licensee the fact that the Entity against whom the named Licensee has asserted the patent infringement claim is a DPL User or its Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, a patent infringement claim made against an Entity that was not a DPL User or its Affiliate at the time the claim was made does not trigger the revocation right under this Section 2.2(c), even if such Entity later becomes a DPL User.
  
	*(ii)* Licensee discontinues being a DPL User, as of the date of such Licensee’s Discontinuation Date; or

	*(iii)* Licensee transfers a Patent to an Entity other than a DPL User without conditioning the transfer on the transferee continuing to abide by the terms of this license for as long as Licensee is a DPL User.
 
### Assignment and Change of Control ###

1 Assignment. No Licensor or Licensee or its Affiliate may assign this Defensive Patent License or its rights hereunder, including but not limited to by operation of law, and any attempt to do so shall be void.

2 Change of Control. In the event that a DPL User undergoes a Change of Control, and the Controlling Party or Surviving Party, as applicable, is not itself a DPL User as of the effective date of such Change of Control, then the DPL User undergoing the Change of Control shall automatically cease to be a DPL User as of the effective date of such Change of Control plus three years, and such effective date shall be deemed to be its Discontinuation Date, unless the Controlling Party or the Surviving Party, as applicable, elects to become a DPL User by issuing an Offering Announcement.

'Change of Control' means, with respect to a DPL User, that at least one of the following conditions is true:
        (a) the direct or indirect acquisition (except for transactions described in clause (b) of this subsection below), whether in one or a series of transactions by any Entity or related Entities (the 'Controlling Entity') of (i) ownership, beneficial or otherwise, of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such DPL User, the result of which acquisition is that such Controlling Entity possesses 50% or more of the combined voting power of all then-issued and outstanding capital stock of such DPL User, or (ii) the power to elect, appoint, or cause the election or appointment of at least a majority of the members of the board of directors (or such other governing body that exercises a similar level of control) of such DPL User (in the event such DPL User or any successor Entity is not a corporation);
        (b) a merger, consolidation or other reorganization or recapitalization of such DPL User with an Entity or a direct or indirect subsidiary of such Entity (the 'Surviving Entity'), provided that the result of such merger, consolidation or other reorganization or recapitalization, whether in one or a series of related transactions, is that the holders of the outstanding voting stock of such DPL User immediately prior to such consummation do not possess, whether directly or indirectly, immediately after the consummation of such transaction, in excess of 50% of the combined voting power of all then-issued and outstanding stock of the Surviving Entity, or its direct or indirect parent.


### Disclaimer of Warranties ###

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE PATENT LICENSE GRANTED HEREIN “AS IS” AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PRACTICING ANY LICENSED PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISCOVERABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IN WHICH CASE SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Licensor disclaims any and all warranties as to title or the validity of its Licensed Patents or that the exercise of the License granted by Licensor hereunder will not infringe the patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any third party.

5. Disclaimer of Liability

LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF WARRANTY, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.

6. Miscellaneous

6.1 Nothing contained in this Agreement or the performance thereof is intended or shall be construed to create any relationship of agency, partnership or joint venture between or among the parties or their Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an agreement by a Licensor to bring actions or suits against non-DPL Users or their Affiliates for infringement of its Licensed Patents, or conferring any right to a Licensee to bring actions or suits against third parties for infringement of the Licensed Patents. The provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply in accordance with their terms even after the withdrawal of an Entity from the DPL through issuance of a Discontinuation Notice.

6.2 Each DPL User and its Affiliates acknowledge and agree that a significant benefit and consideration for entering into this Agreement is to avoid the risks and uncertainty of litigation with respect to the Licensed Patents of other DPL Users and their Affiliates, a benefit which derives in significant part from the license rights that each DPL User and its Affiliates receive collectively from all other DPL Users and their Affiliates, and the DPL therefore does not reflect a royalty that any DPL User or its Affiliate might otherwise have negotiated at arms’ length with respect to any one or more particular Licensed Patents apart from this Agreement and its collective license rights, nor what would constitute a reasonable royalty or a measure of damages with respect to the enforcement of any particular Licensed Patent in any dispute or transaction outside the scope of this Agreement. Each DPL User and its Affiliates further agrees that it obtains a unique benefit from the portfolio-wide nature of the cross-licenses granted herein, and that infringement of any particular patent(s) subject to this agreement therefore may not be adequately compensated by money damages, notwithstanding the existence of the licenses granted hereunder to such patent(s).

6.3 Each DPL User and each of its Affiliates shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement with the right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement directly against Licensor.

If the DPL Foundation should announce on the DPL website an updated version of this agreement, then, as of one year after the announcement of the new version (such time being the 'Upgrade Time'), all parties to this agreement automatically consent to its replacement with the updated version unless they opt-out by submitting an Opt-Out annoucement to the DPL Foundation before the Upgrade Time.
